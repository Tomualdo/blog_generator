### Relevation of SSG (Static site Generator)

Thanks To [fmash16](https://fmash16.github.io/content/posts/ssg5_site.html) I've found this awesome static site generator.
This POSIX compliable shell script has been written by [Roman Zolotarev](https://www.romanzolotarev.com/). The documentation for this project can be found [here](https://www.romanzolotarev.com/ssg.html)
